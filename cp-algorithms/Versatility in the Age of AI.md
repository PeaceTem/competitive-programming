### How to be luckier using social network theory.

This post is not meant for you; keep on scrolling.

I remember a day my lecturer said there are approx. about 5 hops between you and anybody on the planet.

I tried to visualize this in my head. You -> 150 -> 150^2 -> ... -> 150^5 (approx. 76 billion people)

The end product is about 10 times the population of human beings

This is because of the flaws present in the calculation / estimation:
1. I assume everyone is connected to exactly 150 people. Know that this number is not the same for everyone. The number 150 itself was chosen because I read, some time ago, that people realistically get close to 150 other people.
2. The calculation above ignore the fact that some of the people person A is connected to are also connected to one another. If we put this into consideration, there are going to be about ... billion people 

The major point is getting luckier as a result of have a good network of people around you.

Kindness, Retaliation, forgiveness, trust, etc.

In the words of Geoffrey Hinton (2024 nobel prize winner in physics), I'm someone who doesn't know what field he's in, but wants to know how the brain works. And in knowing how the brain works, I built something that works ridiculously well.
