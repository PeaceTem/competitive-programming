## 🔹 **1. Set Your Foundation (Week 0–2)**

- **Choose one resource** for structured basics (e.g., Duolingo, Babbel, Assimil, or a beginner grammar book).
    
- **Focus on survival phrases & pronunciation** → greetings, numbers, days, introducing yourself.
    
- Learn **the alphabet & sounds** (especially German Umlauts ä/ö/ü or French nasal sounds).
    
- Start a **personal phrasebook (Notion/Anki/Notebook)** → write things you’d actually say in daily life.

## 🔹 **2. Daily Workflow (Ongoing)**

### **a. Input (Comprehension) — 40%**

- **Listening**:
    
    - 10–15 min/day of slow podcasts (_Coffee Break German/French_, _News in Slow French_).
        
    - Watch YouTube/Netflix with **subtitles in target language**.
        
- **Reading**:
    
    - Start with children’s books, graded readers, or short news (e.g., _LingQ_, _DW Learn German_, _Le Monde des ados_).
        
    - Highlight new words, but don’t stop too much.
        

### **b. Output (Production) — 30%**

- **Speaking** (crucial for fluency):
    
    - 10–15 min self-talk (“I’m cooking rice… I’m opening the door”).
        
    - Record yourself and compare with native audio.
        
    - Weekly 30–60 min language exchange (HelloTalk, italki tutors, Tandem).
        
- **Writing**:
    
    - 3–5 sentences/day journal (keep it simple: “Today I went… It was…”).
        
    - Post short texts on _LangCorrect_ or _Reddit language communities_ for corrections.
        

### **c. Vocabulary & Grammar — 20%**

- **Spaced Repetition**: Use **Anki/Memrise** → 10–15 new words/day max.
    
- Learn **grammar in context** (not long rules). Example: Learn past tense by writing “Yesterday I went…” repeatedly.
    
- Make word families: instead of “to eat,” also learn _eats, ate, eating_.
    

### **d. Review & Active Recall — 10%**

- End of the week: review your phrasebook & Anki.
    
- Try to summarize a YouTube video/article in 5 sentences (spoken/written).

    - 15 min listening
        
    - 15 min reading

## 🔹 **4. Long-Term Growth (Month 3 onwards)**

- Transition from **“study mode” → “living in the language”**.
    
- Change your phone/social media settings to the target language.
    
- Read short novels or blogs.
    
- Start using monolingual dictionaries (French–French, German–German).
    
- Join online communities (Discord, Reddit, language forums).

## 🔹 **5. Mindset & Strategy**

- Accept mistakes → fluency grows from **lots of messy speaking**.
    
- Stay consistent → 30 min daily beats 3 hrs once a week.
    
- Learn what interests you → if you like football, learn words around it first.
    
- Aim for **“can use it” not “perfect grammar”** early on.
