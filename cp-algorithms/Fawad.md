- A football social network - Just football, no noise.


Agenda


	I have an idea about a social network for football lovers. Each fan chooses his/her favorite club. They receive news/updates about their club, leagues, competitions/cups. live scores and live commentary [Watch Party Mode where fans come together in a seperate room to get the live commentary of a particular match.

	There's also a banter room for fans to banter each other / share updates / etc. Additional: there can be bots that also post/comment.

The live score feature should be the last thing to be implemented cos there are already a lot of live score app out there.

There's always a weekly contest for fans to predict outcomes of pre-selected games, and also there's a leaderboard/ranking table for each contest. Each fan also have a prediction Elo. The winner of each contest will be given the MERLIN badge


# Proposal: Football Social Network for Fans

### Introduction

Football is more than a sport, it’s a culture, a community, and for many, a way of life. Fans don’t just watch games; they live them, argue about them, and celebrate (or mourn) them together. The idea behind this platform is to create a **dedicated social network exclusively for football fans**, a place where passion for the game is the driving force.

### Objectives

- Build an online community where fans can connect, banter, and compete.
    
- Start lean with **3–5 core features** to create stickiness and engagement.
    
- Differentiate from typical football apps (which mostly focus on scores and news) by emphasizing **community and competition**.
    

### Core Features (MVP – Hierarchical Order)

1. **Banter Room (Primary Focus)**
    
    - A central hub where fans can argue, joke, troll, and celebrate.
        
    - Bots can be introduced to add humor, trivia, polls, or quick match facts to keep the conversation lively.
        
    - This is the heartbeat of the app, driving daily active usage.
        
2. **Prediction Contests (Second Focus)**
    
    - Weekly contests based on pre-selected matches.
        
    - Fans earn points on a **leaderboard**, with an XP-based rating system to track prediction skill.
        
    - Winners are awarded the **MERLIN Badge**, a status symbol that boosts recognition and competitiveness.
        
3. **Club-Centric Experience**
    
    - Upon signup, fans select their favorite club.
        
    - They receive tailored updates: news, league highlights, and competition summaries.
        
4. **Watch Party Mode**
    
    - Dedicated rooms where fans gather during live matches for real-time commentary and reactions.
        
    - Functions like a virtual “fan zone” to recreate the energy of the stadium.
        

_(Future Addition: Live Scores—only after the community layer is thriving, since many apps already cover this.)_

### Phased Approach

- **Phase 1:** Launch with Banter Room + Prediction Contests to establish community and competitive culture.
    
- **Phase 2:** Introduce Club-Centric Experience and Watch Party Mode.
    
- **Phase 3:** Expand to live scores and other advanced features once user base is solid.
    

### Conclusion

This platform is not just another football app, it’s a **digital football clubhouse**. By focusing first on banter and predictions, we tap into the two things fans love most: **arguing and competing.** From there, we build out into a complete ecosystem where fans feel at home.


I think the best thing is to create a google form about this. - Bro. Adewale.
