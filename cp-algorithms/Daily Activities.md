Proposal: Football Social Network for Fans  
  
Introduction  
  
Football is more than a sport, it’s a culture, a community, and for many, a way of life. Fans don’t just watch games; they live them, argue about them, and celebrate (or mourn) them together. The idea behind this platform is to create a dedicated social network exclusively for football fans, a place where passion for the game is the driving force.  
  
Objectives  
  
- Build an online community where fans can connect, banter, and compete.  
  
- Start lean with 3–5 core features to create stickiness and engagement.  
  
- Differentiate from typical football apps (which mostly focus on scores and news) by emphasizing community and competition.  
  
  
Core Features (MVP – Hierarchical Order)  
  
1. Banter Room (Primary Focus)  
  
- A central hub where fans can argue, joke, troll, and celebrate.  
  
- Bots can be introduced to add humor, trivia, polls, or quick match facts to keep the conversation lively.  
  
- This is the heartbeat of the app, driving daily active usage.  
  
2. Prediction Contests (Second Focus)  
  
- Weekly contests based on pre-selected matches.  
  
- Fans earn points on a leaderboard, with an XP-based rating system to track prediction skill.  
  
- Winners are awarded the MERLIN Badge, a status symbol that boosts recognition and competitiveness.  
  
3. Club-Centric Experience  
  
- Upon signup, fans select their favorite club.  
  
- They receive tailored updates: news, league highlights, and competition summaries.  
  
4. Watch Party Mode  
  
- Dedicated rooms where fans gather during live matches for real-time commentary and reactions.  
  
- Functions like a virtual “fan zone” to recreate the energy of the stadium.  
  
  
(Future Addition: Live Scores—only after the community layer is thriving, since many apps already cover this)  
  
Phased Approach  
  
- Phase 1: Launch with Banter Room + Prediction Contests to establish community and competitive culture.  
  
- Phase 2: Introduce Club-Centric Experience and Watch Party Mode.  
  
- Phase 3: Expand to live scores and other advanced features once user base is solid.  
  
  
Conclusion  
  
This platform is not just another football app, it’s a digital football clubhouse. By focusing first on banter and predictions, we tap into the two things fans love most: arguing and competing. From there, we build out into a complete ecosystem where fans feel at home
